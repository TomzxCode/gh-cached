# Issues

## List issues

```bash
ghx issue list
```

When the cache is fresh, results are served from disk. Otherwise the GitHub API is used.

### Filter by state

```bash
ghx issue list                    # open (default)
ghx issue list --state closed
ghx issue list --state all
```

### Filter by author, assignee, or mention

```bash
ghx issue list --author alice
ghx issue list --assignee bob
ghx issue list --mention carol
```

### Filter by label

Labels use AND logic. Repeat the flag to require all specified labels:

```bash
ghx issue list --label bug
ghx issue list --label bug --label p1
```

### Filter by milestone

Accepts a milestone title (case-insensitive) or number:

```bash
ghx issue list --milestone v2.0
ghx issue list --milestone 5
```

### Search

Case-insensitive substring match against title and body:

```bash
ghx issue list --search "memory leak"
```

### Limit results

```bash
ghx issue list --limit 10
```

When the total exceeds the limit, a summary is printed to stderr:

```
Showing 10 of 42 issues
```

### JSON output

```bash
ghx issue list --json
```

Outputs a pretty-printed JSON array of issue objects.

### Disable title truncation

By default, titles are truncated to 60 characters. Use `--no-truncate` to show full titles:

```bash
ghx issue list --no-truncate
```

## View a single issue

```bash
ghx issue view 42
```

### Show comments

```bash
ghx issue view 42 --comments
```

### Force refresh

Bypass the cache and fetch the latest data from GitHub, updating the cache:

```bash
ghx issue view 42 --refresh
```

### JSON output

```bash
ghx issue view 42 --json
```
